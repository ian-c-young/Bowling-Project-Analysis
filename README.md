# Bowling-Project-Analysis
This is a simple class project involving the design of an experiment, collection of data, and statistical analysis. I used R (lots of tidyverse) and Quarto to code this report for my group.  Two-Way ANOVA was used along with tests for pairwise comparisons adjusting for multiple comparisons.
